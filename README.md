# book_api

Using the google books api I was able to request data via requests module. 
The user is able to query the google books api and find books on the topics related to their search.
The user is then able to create a reading list of books from their search add save desired books to their reading list.



```python
import requests using pip install requests in Terminal
import unittest to test Functions in the class book_search

```
